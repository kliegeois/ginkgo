 * An index_span is a lightweight structure used to describe a contiguous span
 * of indices of one dimension.
 *
 * The main purpose of the index_span is to create sub-ranges from other ranges.
 * An index_span `is` represents a contiguous set of indexes in one dimension of
 * the range, starting from `is.begin` (inclusive) and ending at index `is.end`
 * (exclusive). An index_span is only valid if its end is larger than its
 * beginning.
 *
 * index_spans can be compared using `==` and `!=` operators. Two spans are
 * equal iff both their `begin` and `end` values are identical.
 *
 * index_sets also have two distinct partial orders defined:
 * 1. `x < y` (`y > x`) iff `x.end < y.begin`
 * 2. `x <= y` (`y >= x`) iff `x.end <= y.begin`
 * Note: `x < y || x == y` is not equivalent to `x <= y`.
